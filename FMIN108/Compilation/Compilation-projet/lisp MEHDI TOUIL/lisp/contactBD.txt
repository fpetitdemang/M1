MASTER1 IMS / Génération de code (UMIN122)
------------------------------------------

[0] ARBORESCENCE

    - Executable:		
	launcher.sh			Script shell éxecutable automatisé

    - LISP:
	dictionnary2automate.lsp	Conversion du dictionnaire en automate
	automate2asm.lsp		Compilation de l'automate en pseudo-ASM
	vm.lsp				Machine virtuelle & fonctions associées
	fct.lsp				Fonctions utiles à la machine virtuelle

    - text:
	DIC.TXT				Dictionnaire de mots utilisé
	AUTOMATE.TXT			Automate généré
	ASM.TXT				Pseudo-ASM généré
	README				Celui-là même

    - traces:
	TRACES				Code pré-généré du gros dictionnaire
	DICOS				Plusieurs dictionnaires de test


[1] MECANISMES

	DIC.TXT		--->	dictionnary2automate.lsp --->	AUTOMATE.TXT
	AUTOMATE.TXT	--->	automate2asm.lsp	 --->	ASM.TXT
	ASM.TXT		--->	vm.lsp


	Le fichier DIC.TXT est "mouliné" à travers les fonctions
	de dictionnary2automate.lsp afin de produire un automate
	dans le fichier AUTOMATE.TXT.
	Ce dernier est à son tour "transcodé" avec les fonctions
	de automate2asm.lsp en pseudo-assembleur dans le fichier
	ASM.TXT.
	Enfin, la machine virtuelle issue de vm.lsp est lancée,
	elle récupère les instructions du fichier ASM.TXT pour
	ensuite les éxecuter.

	L'utilisateur rentre un mot de son choix, en fonction de
	s'il figure ou pas dans DIC.TXT (la casse est respectée), 
	un message s'affichera.

[2] EXEMPLES

	A partir d'un dictionnaire DIX.TXT de 27607 mots contenant
	l'occurence "zygmunt", pour valider ce dernier, la commande
	"time" nous donne:

	15651.25user 133.54system 4:27:35elapsed 98%CPU
	(0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
	0inputs+0outputs (0major+22567821minor)pagefaults 0swaps

	Par contre une fois le fichier ASM.TXT généré, le charger
	et l'utiliser dans la vm est très rapide (moins d'une seconde).
	L'argument passé correspond approximativement à la taille
	mémoire nécessaire:

% clisp -E iso-8859-1 vm.lsp `cat ASM.TXT | wc -l | sed s/\ //g`

UMIN141 - TER GENERATION DE CODE
Université Montpellier II - Master M1

0 - INTRODUCTION

	Le projet se decompose en deux parties: 

		- Le compilateur "compilo.lsp" qui via la commande <compiler> compile du code LISP en pseudo-assembleur.

		- La machine virtuelle "mv.lsp" qui charge un environnement virtuel et interprète le code pseudo-assembleur et retourne le résultat correspondant.


1 - UTILISATION

	Pour utiliser le projet, on peut procéder par les deux manières suivantes:

	Soit en lancant manuellement chaque fichier et en chargeant étape par etape via "clisp":

		(LOAD "compilo.lsp")
		(LOAD "mv.lsp")
		(mvLAUNCH 'vm 10000)
		(mvLOAD (compiler '(+ 1 2)))
		(princ (mvRUN 'vm))
		(mvRESET 'vm)
		(mvLOAD (compilerFichier 'example-fibo-cond.lsp))
		(princ (mvRUN 'vm))

	Soit en utilisant le "mini-shell" via "clisp shell.lsp":

		1 ou 2 ou 3 ... ou 8 pour tester les différents exemples
		memview pour afficher la mémoire de la vm
		exit pour sortir du "mini-shell"
